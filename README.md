## What is Llamalerts
Llamalerts is a Chrome Extension that aims to automate the process of constantly checking the Deviantart badges page for the "Give Llama Badge".

Essentially what Llamalerts does is allow you to load the Deviantart Badges page and go do other things while it reloads the page and looks for any "Give Llama Badge" options for you. Once the 'Give Llama Badge" is available a [sound cue](http://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/alert-beep_0.mp3) will play.

## How To Use:

1. Load your Deviantart badges page.

2. Click the extension to the right of the url bar. It will be a black icon with a white L.

3. Click on the toggle switch to begin looking for llama badges.

4. Go do something else.

5. When you no longer want to run the extension **go back to the Deviantart Badges page** and click the toggle switch again.
   - in its current state the extension is active across all pages, so it's important you go back to the DA badges.
