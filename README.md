##What is Llamalerts
Llamalerts is a Chrome Extension that aims to automate some of the processes related to giving llama badges on Deviantart.


Essentially what Llamalerts does is allow you to load the *.deviantart.com/badges page and go do other things in your browser while it reloads the page and looks for any "Give Llama Badge" options for you; alerting you via a sound cue when an option does popup.


##How To Use:

1. Load your Deviantart badges page.

2. Click the extension to the right of the url bar. It will be a black icon with a white L.

3. Select the "Start" button to begin looking for llama badges.

4. Go do something else.


If you want to stop the extension just open it and select stop.


****Note****: This addon is currently under development and while it's currently functional it is missing a few features and may have bugs. If you notice abnormal behavior feel free to make an issue and I will get to it when I can.
